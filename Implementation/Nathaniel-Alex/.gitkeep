The Plan:
1. Ask the user for 2 numbers
2. Add those nunbers together
3. Get the last digit of the number with / 10 and assign it to a variable (num1)
4. Assign the number without the last digit to a variable (num2)
5. Add both of those variables together
6. Loop until you get a single digit number
